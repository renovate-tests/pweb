Yey! Finally an update to my website. Been ages since I wrote something.

To those not aware, there are a lot of under the hoods update to the site but I mostly forget to document them (enter shruggie emoticon here). 

Well, anyway...

A new menu tab has been added (AWESOME!!). I've finally decided to showcase my graphic design works, aside from my photographs.

It's still a work in progress but I'm trying to add more content as they come. I've not forgotten about the photos. I'll be updating those as well.

Until then...
